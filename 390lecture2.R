# Two types of statistics: descriptive & inferential
# Descriptive: Mean, median, histogram, scaterplot, range
# Inferential: Making a guess about a population from a sample

# Quanatative variables : Continuous & Discrete
# Continuous : x is a member of the full set of real numbers
# Discrete : x is a member of the set of all integers

# Qualatative (Categorical)
# Like state of coin, type of computer, letter grade

# "Level" is the number of outcomes (Like 2 for coin states)

# "Cases" -> how many rows (IE. how many people)

# Given the example of time data (1.13, ..., 1.51, ..., 2.10, ...)
# 20 or more levels -> more like continuous
# less than 20 -> more like discrete

# SOCS
# Center -> "typical grade/score/x"
# Spread -> "typical deviation"
